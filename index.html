            <h1>The Topic of a Universal Language</h1>
                <p>Created by Charles Wang</p>

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>&emsp;A universal language is a highly controversial topic, but many people don't even recognize this. This is because so many people have just spoken or interacted with other people with one language. This should all change. If you know or have relatives who speak a different language and are trying to interact with you, it may be hard if you do not know their language or if they do not know your language. Dealing with these problems can easily be solved using the concept of a universal language.</p>
                <p>&emsp;Humans have long attempted to make a universal language. With the collapse of the Roman Empire, Latin was not tied to any country no longer. It was the perfect universal language. However, it only got around Europe. The Far East was too far away to be affected by the Latin craze, and even if it got there, the primary languages spoken there were so different from Latin that it would have been ineffective. Eventually, when the Protestant Reformation was in full effect, Latin fell into disuse. Meanwhile, in Asia, Chinese was used as an international written language, as Japanese and Korean were devised from Chinese. However, it didn't last long, as spoken words were a lot more important, and Chinese was ineffective as a spoken international language.</p>

Accessed 17 Oct. 2023.<br>Original (English): "Basic English, simplified form of English developed between 1926 and 1930 by the British writer and linguist Charles Kay Ogden. Intended for use as an international second language, it enjoyed some popularity for more than a decade, but subsequently the language was little used."<br>Annotation: This article states that Basic English is not very renowned as an international language. Mr. Ogden did not succeed in creating a long-lived universal language, but his attempt was only one example of humans attempting to create a universal language. This source is trustworthy because it is an encyclopedia article. It has probably been verified by many people. A con is the fact that we cannot tell who wrote it, but that does not matter due to the encyclopedia's credibility. This is helpful to the research because it gives an example of humans and their need for efficient communication.</li>
                <li>Chemla, Alexandre. "The Advantages and Disadvantages of a Universal Language." Canada.ca, https://canada.ca, 26 July 2021, www.noslangues-ourlanguages.gc.ca/fr/blogue-blog/langue-internationale-global-language-fra. Accessed 5 Oct. 2023.<br>Original (French): "Avantage 1 : Facilite les communications entre différentes cultures. Une langue internationale facilite les communications entre différentes cultures. La langue a toujours été le pivot de l'identité culturelle. Une langue internationale élimine les obstacles à la communication et offre un moyen de comprendre la culture d'autre..."<br>Annotation: The author is trying to state that a universal language supports understanding between all the individual countries. In fact, the article even states that a universal language eliminates any roadblocks in the communication between different countries. This source is credible because it has been reviewed by the publisher (the official website of Canada). However, the author may not have too much experience, as he is still in college and has not been out 'in the field' yet. This source is useful to the research because it states very clearly the advantages of a universal language.</li>

Education about Asia, www.asianstudies.org/publications/eaa/archives/in-search-of-a-universal-language-past-present-and-future/. Accessed 23 Oct. 2023.<br>Original (English): "In any case, several centuries ago, Latin, originally the language of Italy, became the universal language of Europe and modern science. It spread and flourished based on the military, commercial, political, and cultural power of the Roman Empire... ...during the seventeenth century, Galileo Galilei, Isaac Newton, and others began to write in their native languages, not only to give their works broader and more popular appeal, but also to express support for the Protestant Reformation. In addition, they reflected the nationalist sentiments of the time. However, some European scholars still worried that having no single universal language impeded scientific research and progress. With nothing promising in sight, they became multilingual, using English, French, and German... ...in Asia, scientific research was done primarily in a single language: Classical Chinese. At least, it was the universal language in some of that part of the world in its written form; in its spoken form (written Chinese is not phonetic), it was not."<br>Annotation: [This version is available in the notecards] The author is trying to state an important topic in these sentences: modern humans are not made to have a universal language. Latin was used, but it fell into disuse because of religious views. In the Far East, Chinese was used, but could not be used for speaking terms and agreements with one another. This article's author (John Copper) is a very prestigious professor from Rhodes College. He is a professor of international studies, giving him an authoritative view on this topic. However, it may be considered outdated; it is from 2017. This article is beneficial because it states a few examples of where humans attempt to make an international language out of something that is there, but fail.</li>

Accessed 6 Oct. 2023.<br>Original (English): "Having a universal language brings everyone together. We can understand people and this allows us to move in the same direction. A good example is the partnerships we see between companies in different countries. The result is people get great products and services."<br>Annotation: This source states that a universal language brings people closer together and lets people move together. The result would therefore be better resources to be used. A advantage of this source is the fact that it has probably been reviewed by editors. A disadvantage is that this source does not give a publication date. We cannot be sure if this information is still accurate or not. This article is beneficial to the research due to the fact that it is useful in finding the benefits of an international language, not only just providing facts.</li>
                <li>"Esperanto." Encyclopaedia Britannica, School, Middle ed., school.eb.com, school.eb.com/levels/middle/article/Esperanto/33024. Accessed 17 Oct. 2023.<br>Original (English): "Esperanto is probably the most successful of the artificial international languages. The number of Esperanto speakers is estimated at more than 100,000. The Universala Esperanto-Asocio (founded 1908) has members in 83 countries, and there are 50 national Esperanto associations and 22 international professional associations that use Esperanto."<br>Annotation: The article describes Esperanto and its history. In fact, Esperanto is still popular. This article is credible; it came from an encyclopedia. However, it may not be current. This article is useful to the research because it gives an example of a minor international language.</li>

Accessed 16 Oct. 2023.<br>Original (English): "From a Western sense, globalization was made possible due to English. In a world with hundreds of popular languages and dialects, it's natural to need a common universal language, especially for people from different ethnicities, to communicate with each other.<br>This belief is backed by how countries with different languages have co-opted English. From India to China to the Philippines, English has only been growing in popularity."<br>Annotation: This article is trying to state that English is already a international language. Around the world, English has already been recognized as a universal language. This article is trustworthy due to its currency, its non-biased main text (it provides reasoning and also gives it from different points of view), and it has probably been reviewed before it was put online. However, we do not have a clear author with credentials. This article assists the research by supplementing with a summative of the fact that English is only growing in popularity as a world language.</li>

Accessed 17 Oct. 2023.<br>Original (English): "The idea of a universal language that could transcend or dissolve national language barriers was first entertained by the ancient Greeks. During the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, Latin was the international language of Europe..."<br>Annotation: The article states that a universal language was basically dreamt of since language separated. It tells use about the Renaissance's use of Latin due to the fact that it didn't 'belong' to one country or the other. This source is trustworthy because it has been reviewed by database inspectors. However, it is not clear who the author is. This article benefits the research because of the background information on the history of a universal language and an example of a mildly successful attempt at adopting one.</li>

Accessed 17 Oct. 2023.<br>Original (English): "[Needs background quote from Genesis 11:1 and Genesis 11:6-8] Today, the people of the world use more than 6,000 different languages and innumerable dialects. The unity is gone. We no longer understand each other. However, many linguists believe that we actually do speak one language. While words are important, they're just the beginning. To linguists, real language is grammar, the structure that every language is built on... ... Linguists believe that universal grammar and its interaction with the rest of the brain is the design mechanism that allows children to become fluent in any language in the first few years of their lives.<br>Annotation: The quotes from Genesis say it all: we are just too diverse. While we have over 6,000 different languages, we could have had just had one. As the article states, no longer do we stand together. If you matched up two random people from two different random countries and tried to get them to speak to each other, the chances that they would understand each other is very slim. However, there is the one thing that links all of language: grammar. It is the foundation of the house where language sits on. It goes on to state that this allows children to learn languages quickly, even if it is not their home language. This article is trustworthy because it has been reviewed by the SIRS Issues Researcher team. However, it is probably not up to date, as it is from over 20 years ago. Finally, this article benefits the research by giving another good example of a universal 'language' and how it works, which is a key point.</li>
                <li>Pachina, Elizaveta, editor. "Advantages and Disadvantages of English being a Global Language." Teflcourse.net, International TEFL, 1 June 2020, www.teflcourse.net/blog/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-english-being-a-global-language-ittt-tefl-blog/. Accessed 13 Oct. 2023.<br>Original (English): "[English]'s grammar is generally simpler than most languages. It dispenses completely with noun genders (hence, no dithering between le plume or la plume, or between el mano or la mano), and often dispenses with the article completely (e.g. It is time to go to bed). The distinction between familiar and formal addresses was abandoned centuries ago (the single English word you have seven distinct choices in German: du, dich, dir, Sie, Ihnen, Ihr, and euch). Case forms for nouns are almost non-existent (except some personal pronouns like I/me/mine, he/him/his, etc), as compared to Finnish, for example, which has fifteen forms for every noun, or Russian which has 12. In German, each verb has 16 different forms (Latin has a possible 120!), while English only retains 5 at most (e.g. ride, rides, rode, riding, ridden) and often only requires 3 (e.g. hit, hits, hitting)."<br>Annotation: This article also states that English is just made to become an international language. It does not deal with gender cases (i.e le, la) or any informal and respectful callings (i.e you is used for both, in French you must deal with tu and vous) and has a much simpler grammar overall. This article is credible because of its currency, and the author's credentials (an experienced English teacher abroad). However, it has a disclaimer saying that it may not represent the views of TEFL. The article is beneficial to the research due to its examples of how English is dominating and the reasons behind it.</li>
                <li>Shirmohammadli, Zachary. "Advantages and Disadvantages of English as a Global Language." Medium.com, Medium, 25 Sept. 2021, zachshirow.medium.com/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-english-as-a-global-language-cfb20c282a60. Accessed 13 Oct. 2023.<br>Original (English): "With all these numbers, if we did not have a way to communicate with each other, we would have faced a lot of problems. We wouldn't be able to know about each other's cultures, wouldn't be able to have good friends, have diplomatic relations with one another, and so on. With that, it is evident that having an international language that most of the population can understand is a key element in having a peaceful and advanced world."<br>Annotation: This article simply states that there are too many languages in the world. If there wasn't an efficient enough way to communicate with each other, we would be in trouble. We would not be able to keep peace, or probably even keep basic trade relations with each other. Misunderstandings are big (in French, est can mean east or is), and can lead to big problems. The article is credible because, first, the author has his own subdomain. This means that he is an authorized poster on this website. Second, this article is recent, and does not maintain any bias. However, the author does not necessarily have the proper credentials to be writing on this topic. This article is useful to the research because of its examples of the bad things that are happening now that could be solved with a universal language.</li>
                <li>"A Universal Language?" Ohio State University: Class Blog, u.osu.edu, 21 Apr. 2021, u.osu.edu/writing/2021/04/21/a-universal-language/. Accessed 10 Oct. 2023.<br>Original (English): "The simple answer as to why it has not occurred has to do with language's relationship to culture. The extended answer being that Earth will most likely never have a universal language because of technical, scientific, as well as cultural factors.<br>&emsp;In Thomas Devlin's article, What is Esperanto, and Who speaks it?, he states that there are more than 7,000 languages spoken in the world today. With all of these languages existing around us, a Polish medical doctor, Ludwik Lejzer Zamenhof, created the language known as Esperanto, which was meant to "bring the world together as one (Devlin, 2)."...Esperanto was created on the roots of Latin in order to make it easier for those who speak languages that were born from Latin (Russian, Polish, English, German). Zamerhof's idea was to receive feedback from others to evolve the language, and not place restrictions within it like other languages tend to do. While Esperanto seemed to have some advantages, those whose first language did not have strong European influences, such as Asian languages, were at a complete disadvantage."<br>Annotation: This website provides both pros and cons. When looking into an issue, it is always good to have backup to find if the cons state something that may be useful in the research. This article gives a citation about Esperanto, one of the most popular artificial universal languages there is. It gives a con: Asian speakers are at a disadvantage. However, this is useful for allowing people to see that this is a disadvantage, and that it may be fixed. The article is from an educated person in the class blog. Their credentials are unknown, but we know that they came from a university. Finally, this article supplements the research by showing us some cons, and allowing us to widen our mindset instead of focusing on one topic.</li>
