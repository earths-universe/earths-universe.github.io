            <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>A universal language is a highly controversial topic, but many people don't even recognize this. This is because so many people have just spoken or interacted with other people with one language. This should all change. If you know or have relatives who speak a different language and are trying to interact with you, it may be hard if you do not know their language or if they do not know your language. Dealing with these problems can easily be solved using the concept of a universal language.</p>
                <p>Humans have long attempted to make a universal language. With the collapse of the Roman Empire, Latin was not tied to any country no longer. It was the perfect universal language. However, it only got around Europe. The Far East was too far away to be affected by the Latin craze, and even if it got there, the primary languages spoken there were so different from Latin that it would have been ineffective. Eventually, when the Protestant Reformation was in full effect, Latin fell into disuse. Meanwhile, in Asia, Chinese was used as an international written language, as Japanese and Korean were devised from Chinese. However, it didn't last long, as spoken words were a lot more important, and Chinese was ineffective as a spoken international language.</p>
