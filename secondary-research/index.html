            <h3>Information Collected</h3>
            <p>&emsp;An idea of a universal language has been around since ancient times. But a real look at what a universal language looked like was right after the collapse of the Roman Empire. First, there was Latin. After the collapse of the Roman Empire, Latin dissolved into French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, and Romanian. During the Renaissance, Latin was revived, and having no ties with a formal country allowed it to flourish as an international language.</p>
            <p>&emsp;However, Latin died out. Nowadays, there are a lot of problems with having so many languages.</p>
            <p>&emsp;We have a lot of obstacles in the way if we have so many linguistic factors. We are not be able to speak efficiently, and we do not have good relationships due to our differences. To state the obvious, an international language is [obviously] a topic that we need to work on now.</p>
            <p>&emsp;A universal language allows bonding between more people in different countries. It makes communication clearer and allows for companies to connect, increasing the quality of goods.</p>
            <p>&emsp;One attempt at a universal language (and perhaps the best) was Esperanto. With over one hundred thousand speakers to date, it is a popular choice for a universal language. There is even a Universala Esperanto-Asocio (Universal Esperanto Association), with even more individual national groups. It is taken so seriously, some international business groups use Esperanto as a primary language.</p>
            <p>&emsp;Esperanto is the closest we have to a universal language. Sadly, it is not completely used universally yet, due to many other "people" factors. Cultural influences have created over 7000 universal languages, and anyways Esperanto was created from Latin. Asian lingual speakers would have no experience to the Latin-based language, and it would not be fair to different people.</p>
            <p>&emsp;Another attempt at making a universal language was 'Basic English'. Created by a Briton named Charles Kay Ogden in the late 1920s, it was purposed as a universal secondary learner language. Sadly, it only gained popularity for ten years, before finally dying out.</p>
            <p>&emsp;We <i>could</i> try to use English as a global language. It has a very easy grammar, and doesn't need distinction between different words for different genders (i.e bienvenu and bienvenue). There is also no real "official" and "standard" addressing; in French you can be written as "tu" (informal) or "vous" (formal). Anything that involves permutations with words does is about impossible in English. Also, with the verb participles, there are way fewer than any other Romanic or Germanic language.</p>
            <p>&emsp;In conclusion, I don't think that we'll have another popular universal language in my lifetime. But I think that by the end of human civilization, we will probably have one or two languages left around.</p>
